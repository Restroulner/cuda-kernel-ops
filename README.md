# CUDA Kernel Ops

Optimized CUDA kernels for custom neural network architectures. This project provides a collection of highly efficient GPU-accelerated operations designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models, particularly for specialized or novel architectures where standard libraries might not offer optimal solutions.

## Features
- **Custom CUDA Kernels:** Hand-optimized kernels for specific neural network layers and operations.
- **Performance Boost:** Achieve significant speedups for compute-intensive tasks.
- **Integration Friendly:** Designed to be easily integrated into existing deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow via custom ops).
- **Low-level Control:** Provides fine-grained control over GPU hardware for maximum efficiency.

## Getting Started
To compile and use these kernels, you will need a CUDA-enabled GPU and the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

```bash
nvcc -o my_kernel my_kernel.cu
```

## Usage
```cpp
// Example usage will be added soon.
```
